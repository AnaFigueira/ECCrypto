# ECCryptoLib

## Synopsis
ECCryptoLib is a portable class library with Elliptic Curve Cryptography functions that can be used in Windows applications. The library can be used in Windows Store 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 applications.
The application contains functions to generate Asymmetric keys using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. It also contains functions for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature (ECDSA), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).

## Code Example

TODO

## Motivation

This project is part of a Master's dissertation in which an application for Windows Phone 8.1 was created and this library was implemented to hold the necessary cryptographic functions.

## Installation

To run the code, simply download the source code and run it using Visual Studio 2013 or later.
